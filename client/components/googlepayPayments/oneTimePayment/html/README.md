# One-Time Payments Google Pay Sample Integration

This GooglePay HTML sample integration uses HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. It does not require a build process to transpile the source code. It's just static files that can be served up by any web server.

## Prerequisites

Before running this sample integration, ensure that Google Pay is enabled in your sandbox account. Follow the instructions in the [PayPal documentation to integrate Google Pay](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/checkout/apm/google-pay/#set-up-your-sandbox-account-to-accept-google-pay) to set up your sandbox account to accept Google Pay payments.

### Sample Integration

1. Initialize the PayPal SDK with Google Pay component from PayPal and the Native Google Pay SDK
2. Create a Google Pay session using the PayPal SDK
3. Configure Google Pay payment using the configuration options from the Google Pay Session generated by the PayPal SDK.
4. Generate Google Pay paysheet and create/capture order with PayPal.

This integration does NOT showcase 3DS support when Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) is required.
