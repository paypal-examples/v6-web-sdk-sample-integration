    <h1>Guest Payments</h1>
    <p>
      This is the most basic integration for the Guest Payments flow. Buyer
      eligibility is called on page load, then the buyer clicks on the button to
      start the Guest Payments flow. The presentation mode the buyer experiences
      is based on the eligibilty call, browser permissions, and browser
      capabilities.
