# One-Time Payments HTML Sample Integrations

These sample integrations use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. No build process is required to transpile the source code. It's just static files that can be served up by any web server.

This static example is hosted by the [server application](../../../../../server/node/README.md).

### Sample Integrations

| Sample Integration                                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Recommended](src/recommended/index.html)                                    | Start with this recommended sample integration. It displays all buttons supported by the v6 SDK and includes eligibility logic. It uses the "auto" presentation mode which attempts to launch a popup window and then automatically falls back to the modal presentation mode when the browser does not support popups.                                                                                       |
| [Merchant Async Validation](src/advanced/merchantAsyncValidation/index.html) | This advanced integration demonstrates how to perform asynchronous validation while maintaining proper user transient activation for popup windows. It shows how to pass validation logic as a promise to the SDK's .start() method to prevent popup blocking issues.                                                                                                                                         |
| [Payment Handler](src/advanced/paymentHandler/index.html)                    | This advanced integration uses the experimental "payment-handler" presentation mode. It teaches how to control the fallback logic for presentation modes based on what the browser supports.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| [Redirect](src/advanced/redirect/index.html)                                 | This advanced integration uses the "redirect" presentation mode. It teaches how to do a full-page redirect integration with the PayPal button on button click.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [Direct App Switch](src/advanced/directAppSwitch/index.html)                 | This advanced integration uses the "direct-app-switch" presentation mode. It teaches how to do a full-page redirect integration with the PayPal button on button click. Eligible buyers will instead checkout the the PayPal mobile app.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [Custom Sandboxed Iframe](src/advanced/sandboxedIframe/README.md)            | This advanced integration demonstrates how a merchant can wrap the v6 SDK integration code into their own iframe and what values need to be passed to the [iframe sandbox attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#sandbox). It does require two web servers to demonstrate the use case. Refer to the README in the src/advanced/sandboxedIframe directory to learn more. |
